   "description": "High resolution orthorectified camera images mosaicked and output \nonto a fixed, uniform spatial grid using nearest-neighbor resampling; \nspatial resolution is 0.1m. \nThe digital camera is part of a suite of instruments on the NEON \nAirborne Observation Platform (AOP) that also includes a full-waveform, \nsmall-footprint LiDAR system and the NEON Imaging Spectrometer. In the \northorectification process, the digital imagery is remapped to the same \ngeographic projection as the LiDAR and imaging spectrometer data that is \nacquired simultaneously. The resulting images will share the same map \nprojection grid space as the orthorectified spectrometer and LiDAR imagery. \nSince the digital camera imagery is acquired at higher spatial resolution \nthan the imaging spectrometer data, it can aid in identifying features in \nthe spectrometer images including manmade features (e.g., roads, fence \nlines, and buildings) that are indicative of land-use change.
