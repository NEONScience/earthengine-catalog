   "description": "Height of the top of canopy above bare earth (Canopy Height Model (CHM)); \ndata are mosaicked over the AOP footprint onto a spatially uniform grid \nat 1 m spatial resolution. The CHM is generated by creating a continuous \nsurface of canopy height estimates across the entire spatial domain of \nthe LiDAR survey, derived from the LiDAR point cloud. The point cloud is \nseparated into classes representing the ground and vegetation returns. \nThe ground classified points allow for calculation of a height normalized \npoint cloud to provide a relative estimate of vegetation elevation. A \nsurface is then generated using the height normalized vegetation points \nto produce the CHM. Any canopy heights less than 2m are set to zero for \ndata collected with the Optech Gemini LiDAR sensors, and less than 2/3m \nfor the Riegl and Optech Galaxy sensors.
